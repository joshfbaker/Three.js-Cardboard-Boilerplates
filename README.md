# Three.js + Cardboard Boilerplates

The [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library combined with the [Google Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) enables perhaps the most lightweight VR experience there is.  As Three.js scenes can be rendered in mobile web browsers, these demos should work on all smartphones - no need to purchase expensive hardware or install any software.  I hope these boilerplates reduce the barrier to entry for VR developers and vastly increase the size of the potential audience for VR experiences.
